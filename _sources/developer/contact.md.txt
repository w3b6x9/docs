You can meet other helloSystem users and developers in the `#helloSystem` [Internet Relay Chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) channel at `irc.freenode.net`. 

Alternatively, you can [`#helloSystem:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#helloSystem:matrix.org) from any Matrix client (such as the Element web-based Matrix client). This Matrix channel is [bridged](https://matrix.org/blog/2015/06/22/the-matrix-org-irc-bridge-now-bridges-all-of-freenode) to the IRC channel. Joining via Matrix has the advantage that you will see responses that you may have received while you were offline. So after asking a question, you can come back in a day or so to see if there were any responses.

In any case, please stay in the channel for a few days and do not expect to receive answers immediately, since we are all volunteers.
